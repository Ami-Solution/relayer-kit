# FAQ

## What is Dharma?

Dharma is an open, permissionless protocol that enables anyone to engage in credit-based transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is a Dharma relayer?

A relayer is a source of liquidity on the Dharma network. It connects borrowers with lenders.

You can think of it as a bulletin board where individuals connected on the Internet can post requests to borrow money.

## What is the approval process for becoming a Dharma Relayer?

There is no approval process for launching a Dharma Relayer.

## Why start a Dharma relayer?

We imagine a world in which the majority of financial transactions occur on globally accessible blockchains.

In this new world, being a relayer is akin to an early internet entrepreneur, providing a valuable service on the frontiers of the new economy.

## What technical skills are required to operate a Dharma Relayer?

Nothing outside of the traditional web stack. The only programming language necessary is JavaScript.

## Do I need to conform to any specific branding when launching a Dharma relayer?

No, we intentionally created this starter kit without branding so that you, the entrepreneur, can conceive of and implement your own brand.

We imagine there being many, many relayers -- each differentiated by the market they serve and the brand they build accordingly.
