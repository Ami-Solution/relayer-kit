## FAQ

### What is Dharma?

Dharma is an open, permissionless protocol that enables anyone to engage in credit-based transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

### What is a Dharma relayer?

A relayer is a source of liquidity on the Dharma network. It connects borrowers with lenders. You can think of it as a bulletin board where individuals connected on the Internet can post requests to borrow money.

### What is the approval process for becoming a Dharma Relayer?

There is no approval process for launching a Dharma Relayer.

### Why start a Dharma relayer?

We imagine a world in which the majority of financial transactions occur on globally accessible blockchains. In this new world, being a relayer is akin to an early internet entrepeneur, providing a valuable service on the frontiers of the new economy.

### What technical skills are required to operate a Dharma Relayer?

Nothing outside of the traditional web stack. The only programming language necessary is JavaScript.
